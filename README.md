# reTerm

reTerm is a mobile application aim for language learners. 
As a language learner myself, I understand how hard is it to retain words in another language.
By integrating a dictionary with a flash card system, it makes it more convient for users to use.
reTerm will support both iOS and Android as a cross-platform application built using React Native.
